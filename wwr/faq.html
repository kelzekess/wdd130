                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
                    <p>Absolutely! This trip is suitable for children of all ages. However, children over the age of 8
                        tend to enjoy the experience more. The river offers stunning views and exciting rapids that keep
                        everyone entertained, and guides are always there to ensure safety and fun!</p>

                    <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
                    <p>Whitewater rafting does carry some inherent risks, but safety is our top priority. All guides are
                        Wilderness First Aid certified, and each person wears a Coast Guard-approved life vest. Many
                        non-swimmers have a fantastic time rafting, and guides will provide an engaging safety talk
                        before the trip begins. The most common injuries are minor things like sunburns!</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is included in the trip?</h2>
                    <p>We provide all the necessary camping equipment, including sleeping bags, tents, chairs, utensils,
                        and a waterproof duffle bag. Water and lemonade are included during the day, and you'll enjoy
                        coffee, tea, and hot chocolate in the morning and evening. We also provide 3 meals per day,
                        plus snacks. You can bring your own drinks (beer, liquor, soft drinks), within reasonable
                        limits.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                    <p>Be prepared for both hot and cold weather. We recommend quick-dry clothing, sunscreen, and sturdy
                        shoes or sandals suitable for water and hiking. Donâ€™t forget a good hat, sunglasses with a
                        strap, and a small daypack for hikes. We also suggest bringing a camera to capture the stunning
                        scenery!</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
                    <p>For the best availability, especially during peak seasons, we recommend booking your trip 6 to 12
                        months in advance. If you're flexible with your dates, 6 months in advance is often sufficient.
